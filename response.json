The cookies should be slightly glossy with melted semisweet chocolate chips visible, some oozing slightly. The background should be a rustic wooden surface, with a few scattered chocolate chips and a dusting of flour for texture. Natural lighting enhances the warm tones of the cookies, creating a cozy atmosphere. The cookies are arranged in a casual stack, with a few placed on a cooling rack. Optional garnishes could include a light sprinkle of sea salt on top for contrast.","image_url":"https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-oyW7rQylM2GdFZImolofr5r8/user-zETN0PGlrcYbYkHFAfIeraJD/img-e8a8pGDochBS9m6tqu9XiY6d.png?st=2026-01-18T16%3A13%3A25Z&se=2026-01-18T18%3A13%3A25Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=9346e9b9-5d29-4d37-a0a9-c6f95f09f79d&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2026-01-18T16%3A26%3A59Z&ske=2026-01-19T16%3A26%3A59Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=Mc87pJDe0o0yKzA8oz1x9iflYU19i/4ETwPezDCSAPk%3D","nutrition":{"calories":4063.0,"protein":56.6,"carbohydrates":455.7,"fiber":16.0,"fats":250.0}}
